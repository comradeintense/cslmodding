						Before you decide if you need to invert one of the normal map channels, you need to make sure
						the normal map generator you are using isn't inverting it by default. Some normal map generators
						have settings for inverting the red(x) and green(y) channels, but some of them invert the red
						channel by default.

						A regular normal map with no inversions looks as if it's lit from the top right - that means the
						red channel looks as if it's lit from the right, but the green channel looks as if it's lit from
						the top. That means it appears to be lit from the positive x and y directions which is <Link

				Assets

			<p class="mt-4">
				For regular assets such as buildings, props, vehicles, trees, and citizens, the normal map works
				correctly with no inverted channels, according to the standard described above.
			</p>

				Networks
			</h2>
			<p class="mt-4">
				For faces which are vertex painted magenta the normal map always works just like for any normal asset,
				as described above.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				But for faces which are not vertex painted magenta (that means they use the automatic tiling as networks
				usually do) the green channel usually needs to be inverted.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				If you are creating a network using an asymmetric mesh, you would use the invert flag for the segment
				mesh to appear continuous and not flip every other segment, this will result in the normal map green
				channel being inverted for every other segment. The solution for that is to have 2 different segment
				meshes, one of which would have a flipped mesh or a flipped normal map, depending on the flags it has.
